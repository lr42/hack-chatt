        <h2>Neighborhood Association Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenge Owner:</strong> Perrin Lance, Manager of
          Neighborhood Services
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Impact / Purpose:</strong> This will be helpful with city
          planning and measuring access to city services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Possible Data Sources:</strong> U.S. Census Bureau,
          Neighborhood Association Boundaries, Landscan (from Oak Ridge National
          Laboratory), High Resolution Population Density Maps
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> Calculate and visualize in a dashboard
          the following statistics for each neighborhood association: total
          population, median household income, Race/Ethnicity (Hispanic or
          Latino of any race), %Bachelor's degree or higher, %Language other
          than English spoken at home, %Foreign born population, %65 years or
          older, %poverty. Even better, find a way to create a dashboard that
          automatically syncs and recalculates when a new neighborhood
          association is added to the Neighborhood Association Boundaries data.

          Association Boundaries, Landscan (from Oak Ridge National Laboratory),
          High Resolution Population Density Maps
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> Plot on a map the locations of services
          essential to a thriving community (like grocery stores, health
          clinics/hospitals, community centers, financial services, bus stops,
          water fountains, and pharmacies). Calculate and score the level of
          access to essential services for each neighborhood association area.
          Analyze and determine impact of factors on success rates of assets
          like distance from bus stops. Find a way to create a dashboard that
          automatically syncs and recalculates when a new neighborhood
          association is added to the Neighborhood Association Boundaries data.

        <h2>Text Images to 311</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenge Owner:</strong> Tim Moreland (Administrator of
          Innovation Delivery and Performance)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Impact / Purpose:</strong> Make submitting a 311 request as
          simple as texting an image to 311
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Possible Data Sources:</strong> OPMOD has a zip folder of
          images and a csv linking those images to service requests
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> We are looking for AI and ML
          practitioners who would like to help create a computer vision product
          that will be able to characterize images into common 311 service
          request types. We currently have training and validation data
          available from images pulled from the 311 system.

          <strong>Impact / Purpose:</strong> Make reporting issues related to
          cycling easier (broken glass, blocked bike lane, broken bike repair

        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> Let’s create a new 311 app tailored to
          cyclists and the issues they face. Note: If sending an API request
          doesn’t work. You can also email issues to 311emails@chattanooga.gov,
          which is checked once a day. Action Items: Need to track down more
          data sources and API documentation for 311.

        <h2>Better Bus Map</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenge Owner:</strong> Daniel Dufour, Director of
          Performance Management and Open Data
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Impact / Purpose:</strong> Make catching the bus a more
          pleasant experience, leading to more ridership.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Possible Data Sources:</strong> CARTA Live Bus Tracker, CARTA
          Google Transit Feed Specification Bus Schedules:
          <a href="https://www.gocarta.org/about/developers-center/"
            >CARTA Developers Center</a
          >; API Endpoint:
          <a
            href="http://bustracker.gocarta.org/bustime/map/getBusesForRoute.jsp?route=4"
            >Get Buses For Route</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> The live bus tracker has some
          limitations and it’s time for a new modern version. It would be great
          if it had the following features: Works great on any device (Smart
          Phone, Tablet or Desktop); Remembers favorite bus routes; Animates
          buses so they don’t look as if they are jumping every time a new
          location is pinged. This would require some extrapolation and
          estimation of location based on speed and direction; Loads location
          based on URL parameters. Action Items: OPMOD needs to follow up with
          CARTA on this and if they have input on other priorities/challenges.
